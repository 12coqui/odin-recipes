<h2 class="titulos">About Asado</h2>
<p>A imagen could speak itself. When we, as Argentinian talked about Asado, we go deeper than just
    meat. For us, the smell of the woods burning, the music playing, the long chats with wine or beer,
    a few matches of "truco", and a countless list of things we do at those meetings make a meal, more 
    like a ritual.
